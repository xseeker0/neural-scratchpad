**neural-scratchpad** is a personal laboratory and documentation archive for exploring the depths of Computer Science, with a primary focus on Artificial Intelligence <br/>
The goal of this repository is not just to use libraries, but to understand the **underlying mechanics** of algorithms by implementing them from scratch or dissecting their behaviors.
